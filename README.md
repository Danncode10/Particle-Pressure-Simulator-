# Particle Pressure Simulator  

A Python-based simulation that visualizes particle collisions and their dynamics, replicating high and low-pressure zones through interactive barrier control and particle density visualization.

## Description  
The Particle Pressure Simulator demonstrates how particles behave under varying conditions. Users can control a barrier to influence particle interactions, simulating regions of high and low pressure. The simulation leverages Turtle graphics for a dynamic and engaging visualization of particle physics principles.

## Controls  
- **Up Arrow**: Move the barrier upward.  
- **Down Arrow**: Move the barrier downward.  

## How It Works  
1. **Particle Generation**: A set number of particles are randomly generated on the screen, each with a unique color and direction.  
2. **Barrier Interaction**: A horizontal barrier at the top of the screen can be moved up or down to influence particle movement.  
3. **Collision Dynamics**: Particles bounce off the barrier, walls, and edges, simulating realistic motion.  
4. **Pressure Zones**: The concentration of particles in specific areas of the screen creates visual zones of high and low pressure, mimicking real-world physical phenomena.  
5. **Real-Time Updates**: The simulation runs continuously, dynamically updating particle positions and interactions.
